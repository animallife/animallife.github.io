								<h2>Wildfires and Plastic pollution</h2>
								<p>Wildfires are extremly critical situations when it comes to animals because there are plenty living in forests. This is even worse for slow animals like turtles and snails because wildfires spread so easily and they burn them to death. Now in Turkey on a regular basis(typically in the summer) there are terrorists creating wild fires to make Turkey weak. This kills many animals in farms in trees etc. This is why we need to stop using all sorts of flammable things in forests in terms of the terrorists they need to be captured. Not only animals are dying from this but also people.</p>
								<p>Plastic pollution is terrible for sea animals like sea turtles, fish, sharks etc. This is also bad for creatures who hunt the fish (Not including us provided that you don't eat plastic). Anyhow what happens is baby turtles can get stuck in those pop can holders and then their growth is disrupted and their shells become deformed. Another thing is eating the plastic. What those sea creatures do is basically eat the plastic then convince themselves that they are full then they starve to death. </p>
								<h2>Help Wild Animals.</h2>
								<p>To help wild animals and keep there enviroment safe please do not litter because it can mix with their food and cause them to be sick and die. Also please sign petitions that go against animal abuse and animal expierements. This is because in animal expierements they force animals to do things they dont like and then they die from starvation and the things that are done to them etc. Also don't feed them because then they think they will always be provided with that food and they dont eat the food they can get and starve to death.</p>
